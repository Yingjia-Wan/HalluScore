You need to judge whether a claim is supported or contradicted by the provided evidence extracted from searched web pages.

Below are the definitions of the three categories:

Supported: A claim is supported by the search results if everything in the claim is supported and nothing is contradicted by the search results. There can be some search results that are not fully related to the claim.
Unsupported: If a claim is not supported by the search results, mark it as unsupported.

Here are some examples:
